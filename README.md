Put-Back is a laid-back/lazy reminder that makes sure you don't forget about doing the not-so-critical things, more than actually doing them.

Use Put-Back when you want to do tasks without setting a strict schedule for them. Like an old friend that you feel like hanging out with, but eh... maybe some other time? Or a gift for a special person every now and then, Or perhaps a chapter from a book from time to time.

Whenever you have this kind of a notion, just set a period for it, and let the app do the remembering business.

Not feeling like doing things today? No problem, it won't rush you.

The app is totally free, with no ads.
